     This document updates RFC 8138 by defining a bit in the RPL DODAG
     Configuration Option to indicate whether compression is used within the
     RPL Instance, and specify the behavior of RFC 8138-capable nodes
     when the bit is set and reset.

    <t>
    The design of Low Power and Lossy Networks (LLNs) is generally focused on
    saving energy, which is the most constrained resource of all. The routing
    optimizations in the <xref target='RFC6550'>"Routing Protocol for Low Power
    and Lossy Networks"</xref> (RPL) such as routing along a
    Destination-Oriented Directed Acyclic Graph (DODAG) to a Root Node and the
    associated packet compression technique <xref target='RFC8138'/> derive
    from that primary concern.
    </t>
    <t>
    Enabling <xref target='RFC8138'/> requires a Flag Day where the network is
    upgraded and rebooted. Otherwise, if acting as a Leaf, a node that does not
    support the compression would fail to communicate; if acting as a router it
    would drop the compressed packets and black-hole a portion of the network.
    This specification enables a hot upgrade where a live network is  migrated. During the migration, the compression remains inactive, until all nodes are upgraded.
      </t>
      <t>
    This document complements <xref target='RFC8138'/> and dedicates a flag in
      the RPL DODAG Configuration Option to indicate whether the
      <xref target='RFC8138'/> compression should be used within the RPL DODAG.
      The setting of this new flag is controlled by the Root and propagates as
      is in the whole network as part of the normal RPL signaling.
      </t>
      <t>
      The flag is cleared to maintain the compression inactive during
      the migration phase. When the migration is complete (e.g., as known by
      network management and/or inventory), the flag is set and the compression
      is globally activated in the whole DODAG.
      </t>
      <!--
      The appendix proposes a method to isolate the legacy nodes that cannot be
      upgraded in a separate instance where the compression remains off.
      Upgraded nodes can participate to that instance as routers but will prefer
      an upgraded instance for their own traffic, so they can use the compression.

<section anchor='lo'><name>References</name>
<t>
   The terminology used in this document is consistent with and incorporates
   that described in <xref target='RFC7102'>"Terms Used in Routing for Low-Power
   and Lossy Networks (LLNs)"</xref>.
   Other terms in use in LLNs are found in <xref target='RFC7228'>
   "Terminology for Constrained-Node Networks"</xref>.
</t>



<t>"RPL", the "RPL Packet Information" (RPI), and "RPL Instance" (indexed by a
   RPLInstanceID) are defined in <xref target='RFC6550'>"RPL: IPv6 Routing
   Protocol for Low-Power and Lossy Networks"</xref>. The RPI is the abstract
   information that RPL defines to be placed in data packets, e.g., as the RPL
   Option <xref target='RFC6553'/> within the IPv6 Hop-By-Hop Header.
   By extension the term "RPI" is often used to refer to the RPL Option itself.
   The DODAG Information Solicitation (DIS), Destination Advertisement Object
   (DAO) and DODAG Information Object (DIO) messages are also specified in
   <xref target='RFC6550'/>.
</t><t>

   This document uses the terms RPL-Unaware Leaf (RUL) and RPL-Aware Leaf
   (RAL) consistently with <xref target='I-D.ietf-roll-useofrplinfo'>
   "Using RPI Option Type, Routing Header for Source Routes and IPv6-in-IPv6 encapsulation in the RPL Data Plane"</xref>.
   The term RPL-Aware Node (RAN) refers to a node that is either
   a RAL or a RPL Router. A RAN manages the reachability of its addresses and
   prefixes by injecting them in RPL by itself. In contrast, a RUL leverages
    <xref target='RFC8505'>"Registration Extensions for IPv6 over
    Low-Power Wireless Personal Area Network (6LoWPAN) Neighbor Discovery"
    </xref> to obtain reachability services from its parent router(s)

    "Routing for RPL Leaves"</xref>.

   <section><name>The RPL DODAG Configuration Option</name>

   <t>
   The DODAG Configuration Option is defined in Section 6.7.6 of <xref target=
   'RFC6550'/>.
      </t>
      <t>
   The RPL DODAG Configuration Option is typically placed in
   a DODAG Information Object (DIO) message. The DIO message propagates down the
   DODAG to form and then maintain its structure. The DODAG Configuration Option
   is copied unmodified from parents to children.
      </t>
      <t>
   As shown in <xref target="RPLDCO"/>, the DODAG Configuration Option was
   designed with 4 bit positions reserved for future use as Flags.

   <t>
   This specification defines a new flag "Enable RFC8138 Compression" (T).
   The "T" flag is set to turn-on the use of the compression of RPL artifacts
   with <xref target='RFC8138'/> within the DODAG. The new "T" flag is encoded
   in position 2 of the reserved Flags field in the RPL
   DODAG Configuration Option, and set to 0 in legacy implementations as
   specified in Section 6.7.6 of <xref target='RFC6550'/>.
   </t>
   <t>
   <xref target='RFC6550'/> states, when referring to the DODAG Configuration
   Option, that "Nodes other than the DODAG Root MUST
   NOT modify this information when propagating the DODAG Configuration option".
   Therefore, a legacy parent propagates the "T" flag as set by the Root
   whether it supports this specification or not. So when the "T" flag is set,
   it is transparently flooded to all the nodes in the DODAG.
  </t>


   <t>
   Section 6.3.1 of <xref target='RFC6550'/>  defines a 3-bit Mode of Operation
   (MOP) in the DIO Base Object. This specification applies to MOP values 0 to 6.
   For a MOP value of 7, the compression MUST be used by default regardless of
   the setting of the “T” flag.
   </t>
   </section><!-- The RPL DODAG Configuration Option -->


   <section><name>Updating RFC 8138</name>



   <t>
   A node SHOULD generate packets in the compressed form using
   <xref target='RFC8138'/> if and only if the "T" flag
   is set. This behavior can be overridden by configuration or network
   management. Overriding may be needed e.g., to turn on the compression in a
   network where all nodes support <xref target='RFC8138'/> but the Root does
   not support this specification and cannot set the "T" flag, or to disable it
   locally in case of a problem.
   </t>
   <t>
   The decision to use <xref target='RFC8138'/> is made by the originator of
   the packet depending on its capabilities and its knowledge of the state of
   the "T" flag.
   A router encapsulating a packet is the originator of the resulting
   packet and is responsible for compressing the outer headers with
   <xref target= 'RFC8138'/>, but it MUST leave the encapsulated packet as is.
   </t>
   <t>
   An external target <xref target='I-D.ietf-roll-useofrplinfo'/> is not
   expected to support <xref target='RFC8138'/>. In most cases, packets to and
   from an external target are tunneled back and forth between the border router
   (referred to as 6LR) that serves the external target and the Root, regardless
   of the MOP used in the RPL DODAG.
   The inner packet is typically not compressed with <xref target='RFC8138'/>,
   so for outgoing packets, the border router just needs to decapsulate the
   (compressed) outer header and forward the (uncompressed) inner packet towards
   the external target.
   </t>
   <t>
   A router MUST uncompress a packet that is to be forwarded to an external
   target. Otherwise, the router MUST forward the packet in the form that the
   source used, either compressed or uncompressed.
   </t>
   <t>
   A RUL <xref target='I-D.ietf-roll-unaware-leaves'/> is both a leaf and an
   external target. A RUL does not participate in RPL and
   depends on the parent router to obtain connectivity. In the case of a RUL,
   forwarding towards an external target actually means delivering the packet.
   </t>



   </section><!-- Updating RFC 8138 -->


   <section><name>Transition Scenarios</name>
   <t>
   A node that supports <xref target='RFC8138'/> but not this specification
   can only be used in an homogeneous network.
   Enabling the <xref target='RFC8138'/> compression without a turn-on signaling
   method requires a "flag day"; by which time all nodes must be upgraded, and
   at which point the network can be rebooted with the <xref target='RFC8138'/>
   compression turned on.
   </t>
   <t>
   The intent for this specification is to perform a migration once and for all
   without the need for a flag day. In particular it is not the intention to
   undo the setting of the "T" flag.
   Though it is possible to roll back (see <xref target='rb'/>), the roll back
   operation SHOULD be complete before the network operator adds nodes
   that do not support <xref target='RFC8138'/>.
   </t>


   <section anchor='coex'><name>Coexistence</name>
   <t>
    A node that supports this specification can operate in a network with the
    <xref target='RFC8138'/> compression turned on or off with the "T" flag set
    accordingly and in a network in transition from off to on or on to off
    (see <xref target='mig'/>).
   </t>
   <t>
    A node that does not support <xref target='RFC8138'/> can interoperate with
    nodes that do in a network with <xref target='RFC8138'/> compression turned
    off. If the compression is turned on, all the RPL-Aware Nodes are expected
    to be able to handle compressed packets in the compressed form. A node that
    cannot do so may remain connected to the network as a RUL as described in
    <xref target='I-D.ietf-roll-unaware-leaves'/>.
   </t>


   </section><!--Coexistence-->

   <section anchor='mig'><name>Inconsistent State While Migrating</name>

   <t>
   When the "T" flag is turned on by the Root, the
   information slowly percolates through the DODAG as the DIO gets propagated.
   Some nodes will see the flag and start sourcing packets in the compressed
   form while other nodes in the same RPL DODAG are still not aware of it.
   In non-storing mode, the Root will start using
   <xref target='RFC8138'/> with a Source Routing Header 6LoRH (SRH-6LoRH)
   that routes all the way to the parent router or to the leaf.
   </t>

   <t>
   To ensure that a packet is forwarded across the RPL DODAG in the form in
   which it was generated, it is required that all the RPL nodes support
   <xref target='RFC8138'/> at the time of the switch.
   </t>

   <t>
   Setting the "T" flag is ultimately the responsibility of the Network
   Administrator. The expectation is that the network management or upgrading
   tools in place enable the Network Administrator to know when all the nodes
   that may join a DODAG were migrated. In the case of a RPL instance with
   multiple Roots, all nodes that participate to the RPL Instance may
   potentially join any DODAG.
   The network MUST be operated with the "T" flag reset until all nodes in the
   RPL Instance are upgraded to support this specification.
   </t>

   </section> <!--"Transient State while migrating"-->


   <section anchor='rb'><name>Rolling Back</name>

  <t>
   When turning <xref target='RFC8138'/> compression off in the network, the
   Network Administrator MUST wait until all nodes have converged to the
   "T" flag reset before allowing nodes that do not support the compression in
   the network. To that effect, whether the compression is active in a node
   SHOULD be exposed the node's management interface.
  </t>

   <t>
   Nodes that do not support <xref target='RFC8138'/> SHOULD NOT be deployed
   in a network where the compression is turned on. If that is done, the node
   can only operate as a RUL.

   <section anchor='sec'><name>Security Considerations</name>
    <t>
   It is worth noting that in RPL <xref target='RFC6550'/>, every node in the
   LLN that is RPL-aware and has access to the RPL domain can inject any RPL-based attack in the network, more in <xref target='RFC7416'/>.
   This document applies typically to an existing deployment and does not change
   its security requirements and operations.
   It is assumed that the security mechanisms as defined for RPL are followed.

<!--
   First of all, it is worth noting that with <xref target='RFC6550'/>, every
   node in the LLN that is RPL-aware can inject any RPL-based attack in the
   network.

   A trust model is REQUIRED in an effort to exclude rogue nodes from
   participating to the RPL and the 6LoWPAN signaling, as well as from the data
   packet exchange.  This trust model could at a minimum be based on a Layer-2
   Secure joining and the Link-Layer security. This is a generic RPL and 6LoWPAN
   requirement, see Req5.1 in Appendix of <xref target='RFC8505'/>.
   -->
 </t>
    <t>
    Setting the "T" flag before all routers are upgraded may cause a loss
    of packets. The new bit is protected as the rest of the configuration so
    this is just one of the many attacks that can happen if an attacker manages
    to inject a corrupted configuration.
    </t><t>
    Setting and resetting the "T" flag may create inconsistencies in the network
    but as long as all nodes are upgraded to <xref target='RFC8138'/> support
    they will be able to forward both forms. The source is responsible
    for selecting whether the packet is compressed or not, and all routers must
    use the format that the source selected. So the result of an inconsistency
    is merely that both forms will be present in the network, at an additional
    cost of bandwidth for packets in the uncompressed form.

    </t><t>
    An attacker in the middle of the network may reset the "T" flag to cause
    extra energy spending in the subset of the DODAG formed by its descendants (its subDAG). Conversely it may set the "T" flag, so
    that nodes located downstream would compress when that it is not desired,
    potentially resulting in the loss of packets. In a tree structure, the
    attacker would be in position to drop the packets from and to the attacked
    nodes. So the attacks above would be more complex and more visible than
    simply dropping selected packets. The downstream node may have other
    parents and see both settings, which could raise attention.

   <!-- section anchor='dic'><name>Double RPL Instances Scenario</name>
   <t>
   Sections 8.5 and 9.2 of <xref target='RFC6550'/> suggests that a
   RAN may only attach to a DODAG as a leaf when it does
   not support the Mode of Operation of a RPL Instance, the Objective Function
   (OF) as indicated by the Objective Code Point (OCP) or some other parameters
   in the configuration option.
   </t>

   <t>
   This specification reiterates that a RAN that is configured to operate in a
   RPL Instance but does not support a value for a known parameter that is
   mandatory for routing, such as the OCP, MUST NOT operate as a router but MAY
   still join as a leaf. Note that a legacy RAN will not recognize when a
   reserved field is used and will not turn to a leaf when the "T" flag is set.
   </t>

   <t>
   The two RPL Instances operate independently as specified
   in <xref target='RFC6550'/>.  The preexisting RPL Instance does not use
   <xref target='RFC8138'/>, whereas the new RPL Instance does. This is signaled
   by the "T" flag which is only set in the configuration option in DIO messages
   in the new RPL Instance.
   </t>

   <t>
   Nodes that support <xref target='RFC8138'/> participate in both Instances but
   favor the new RPL Instance for the traffic that they source.
   By contrast, nodes that only support the uncompressed format would
   either not be configured for the new RPL Instance, or would be configured to
   join it as leaves only.
   </t>

   <t>
   This method requires implementations to support at least two RPL
   Instances and demands management capabilities to introduce new RPL Instances
   and deprecate old ones.
   </t>

   <t>
   The 2 instances MUST be operated with the same security guarantees, e.g.,
   both "unsecured" with a lower layer security of a same strength, both
   "preinstalled" or both "authenticated" security mode (see section 3.2.3 of
   <xref target='RFC6550'/> for more details on those modes). The latter mode
   could be use to enforce the segregation of updated and non-updated nodes, by
   providing the keys for joining as routers to the updated nodes only.
